This repository contains 3 files:
1. This read me file which aim is to explain the analysis files in a clear and understandable way
2. The run_analysis.R code which aims will be explaine later
3. The code book file that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.

The aim of this file is to:

0. download the data files
1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
